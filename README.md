# Tech Interview Prep

[Tech Interview Prep](https://scary-prep.herokuapp.com/) is a simple/fun side project I worked on for a couple days. The premise is that it's like a robot interviewer. I was studying for internship interviews & realized when practicing problems that reading them was giving me too much time/control. To more realistically emulate the interview situation I needed something read to me, and I needed a problem to be random.  

It ended up making me laugh (due to the robot voice) instead of getting me in serious study mode, but I'd love to re-work it later on with a database to store questions users have already encountered (so they don't get dupes) and take in new questions from users (thanks Nina for helping add some!). I realized later on that the optimal solution would be more like an Alexa skill, where you can talk back.
