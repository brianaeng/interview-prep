# Tech Interview Prep

## What...
It's like a robot interviewer. It will say a random interview problem out loud (then cycles through the rest of the questions array). The voice sounds as robotic as you'd expect it to (and it makes me laugh), but here it is if ya want it. Just open index.html to run. Feel free to fork and/or PR for fixes, added questions, and whatnot (s/o to Nina for her additions). 

## Why though...
I realized when talking about practicing with people it was often "yeah I got someone to read me a question" (or studying by yourself) so I took the human out of the equation (although it's obviously better to have someone who knows the problem/can ask you questions).
